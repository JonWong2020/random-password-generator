# Random Password Generator

## Description

A project to create a random password generator through use of JavaScript.  The generator will prompt you to select the length of the password (from 8-128 characters) as well as if you would like to add special characters (?, /, +, etc.), lowercase letter, uppercase letters, and numbers.  Please feel free to use this generator if you are having trouble coming up with a password.
